# Jini-Romance

Jini NPNPC MOD is a romance add-on for Baldur's Gate Extended Edition with the Siege of Dragonspear expansion. Thanx to @tipun, as of v3.0, this mod is now EET compatible.

Jini is a Djinni trapped in a lamp which, if you are a non-evil male, will be given to you by a girl you meet at the outset of your adventure. Jini provides you with the usual services of a Djinn of the Lamp and, if you are nice to her, romance may develop. She will never join your party, but she and her lamp accompany you on your way. She craves freedom, and you have the ability to grant it to her.

This is the prequel to the Rjali Romance mod. It sets the scene for what follows in BG2EE.

Jini is capable of equiping your party members, but will do so only if you ask her nicely. If you enjoy struggle in your game, DO NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SERVICE.
